<h1>Which path do you choose?</h1>

<h2>You need to go to the store to buy some groceries but although you take the same route you always do
you find yourself lost and alone. You continue on and end up on a long and winding road and come to a fork. 
You can either go left or right, but the sun is coming down and you do not have time to come back if you choose incorrectly.
