<h1>You arrive at the store.</h1>
<h2>You finally arrive at the store and spend two hours gathering your groceries. You go to the 
register and as you are about to pay you realize you realize that you forgot your wallet at home.
You ask the grocer to hold on to your items and head home to fetch your wallet. On your way back 
you notice that the sun hasn't gone down at all and it was still as bright as when you left your
house. You pass by a dark alley and feel a sudden impact to the back of your head. You lose consciousness.
You wake up in your house with a splitting headache and no memories of the night prior. You notice that the
pantries and fridge are empty and decide to go stock up at the local store.
