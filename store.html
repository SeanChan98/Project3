<h1>You arrive at the store.</h1>
<h2>You finally arrive at the store and quickly start gathering your groceries. You feel something is wrong, very wrong. 
You see the food come to life and they start chasing you. You've been in here too long, but where's here? The grocery store? No, 
no, no none of this is right. None of this is real. You're in a dream and the world around you is collapsing.You wake up in a 
fright injuring your therapist. You don't remember what happened in the dream, no matter how many times you and he try to discuss it.
He sends you home for the day. When you arrive you notice that the pantry and fridge are empty and decide to go stock up at the local store.
