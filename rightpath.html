<h1>Oof.</h1>
<h2>You decide to take the right path and are hit by a car. You manage to stay conscious long enough to 
  see the car that hit you drive away but you don't manage to catch the license plate. You pass out from your injuries 
  and wake up in your bed. You body is sore all over and you have no memories of what you did last night. You
  go to make some cereal but realize you are out of milk. You decide to go to the grocery store and stock up.
