<h1>Which path do you choose?</h1>
<h2>You take the left path and come across a strange mushroom on the road. The mushroom beckons you and you come forth. 
  You know it's strange but there's something about the atmosphere that draws you closer and closer to the mushroom. 
  It tells you to eat it but something in your mind whispers that it's not safe to stay. Do you eat the mushroom or continue on your path?
